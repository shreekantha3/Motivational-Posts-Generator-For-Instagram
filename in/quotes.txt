Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
Believe in yourself.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Don't let yesterday take up too much of today.
The best way to predict your future is to create it.
